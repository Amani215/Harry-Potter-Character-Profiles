*the problem is that the main page is responsive at first but when you go to another one and the go back to it it's not 
responsive anymore..
*the problem is that I can't get Flow to work (it's essential to keep the type character in only one file)

 TO DO:
Add the About and Contact page (should they be in tsx too?)

On the long term:
*Add filters?
